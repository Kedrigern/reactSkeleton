# My React.js Skeleton

A simple skeleton for a React.js app that is not as complex as [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) from Meta.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install react react-dom webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react html-webpack-plugin
```

Run the development server: `npm start`

The app should now be running at:`http://localhost:3000`
